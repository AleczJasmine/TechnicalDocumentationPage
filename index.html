      <header>Exploring The Explorer</header>
      <article>
        <p>
         For this part, we will explore the explorer interface of WEKA. As you can see, there are many functionalities pointed at the top navigation part. But for this part, we will focus on the preprocess tab pointed in the photo below.
       </p>

       <p>
        Just like your common datasets, WEKA represents data in terms of rows and columns. Attributes describe the instances or the data objects in the data sets. Instances on the other hand represent the attributes as these are data objects within the given data set. Attached below is a photo for representation.
      </p>
      <img src="img/2.jpg" alt="Photo representation for WEKA" class="imgdiagram">
      <p>
        For this part, lets try opening a predefined dataset included in WEKA's database. Lets open the file <strong>weather.nominal.arff</strong> by clicking the open file button on the top left side in the preprocess tab. Locate the file in the folder "data".
        After opening the file, we can see how the data in the weather.nominal dataset is represented in an organized manner including a graphic representation for each attribute and attribute value.

    <header>Exploring Datasets</header>
    <article>
     <p> WEKA has a lot of predefined datasets included when we installed the software. These different datasets allow us to explore and understand how each dataset can be represented and edited to produce desired results. An screenshot of two datasets from the predefined datasets includes the <strong>weather.numeric dataset and glass dataset.</strong></p>

  <header>Building a Classifier</header>
  <p>
    For this part, we will understand how to build a classifier by using <strong>J48 to analyze the glass.arff dataset</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    For this part, go to the <strong>classify</strong> tab right beside the preprocess tab. From there on, choose the available classifiers by clicking <strong>choose > classifiers > trees > J48</strong>
  </p>
  <img src="img/6.jpg" alt="Photo representation for WEKA" class="imgdiagram" style="width: 700px;height: 600px" >
  <p>
    After doing so, click the start button and examine the output. Take a close look at the correctly classified instances (the percentage for each instance) and the confusion matrix on where errors might occur during the classification phase.

<section class="main-section" id="filters">
  <header>Using a Filter</header>
  <article>
    WEKA has powerful functionalities that includes using filters. With filters, you can easily filter out data to have a better, cleaner, or more relevant dataset as it can remove missing data, bad characters, outliers, and the like.
    <p>
      Let's open the <strong>weather.nominal.arff dataset</strong> again. Filters have two main categories for filters namely,  <code>unsupervised and supervised filters</code>
      <strong>Supervised Filters</strong> consider the class value, while <strong>unsupervised filters</strong> don't.  For example, the unsupervised discretize filter only considers the attribute being discretized. While it can 'optimize' the number of bins, it does so only with respect to self encoding. However, the supervised <strong>discretize</strong> filter will break the attribute into bins that provide the most information about the class.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Using filters let's us also filter out between <code>attributes and instances</code>
      Recall in the previous sections that <strong>attributes</strong> describe data objects/instances. Hence, they are somewhat like the "header" for a data column. On the other hand, <strong>instances</strong> are the data objects in the data set. Instances represent the attributes.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the <strong>unsupervised attribute filter Remove</strong>, lets look at our weather.nominal dataset. Click <strong>more information</strong> and look at the attributes. Set the <strong>attributeIndices</strong> to <strong>3</strong> and hit the OK button and apply the filter.
    </p>
    <p style="display:flex;">
      <img src="img/8.jpg" alt="Photo representation for WEKA" class="imgdiagram" style="width: 600px;height: 600px">
      <img src="img/9.jpg" alt="Photo representation for WEKA" class="imgdiagram" style="width: 600px;height: 600px" >
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, look at the two photos below, the attribute with the index <strong>3</strong> which was <strong>humidity</strong> is now removed from the dataset. 
    </p>
    <p style="display:flex;">
      <img src="img/10.jpg" alt="Photo representation for WEKA" class="imgdiagram" style="width: 600px;height: 600px">
      <img src="img/11.jpg" alt="Photo representation for WEKA" class="imgdiagram" style="width: 600px;height: 600px" >
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the <strong>UNDO</strong> button to bring back the original dataset. 
    </p>

<section class="main-section" id="visualizing">
  <header>Visualizing Your Data</header>
  <article>
    <p>
      For this part, we are going to use the <strong>iris.arff</strong> dataset. Open the dataset and go to the <strong>visualize</strong> tab in the far right side next to the select attributes tab
    </p>
    <img src="img/12.jpg" alt="Photo representation for WEKA" class="imgdiagram" style="width: 600px;height: 600px" >
    <p>
    As you can see, there are numerous ways on how to graphically represent our data using WEKA. If you click one of the representations, you are presented with a graph. You can customize these "plots" by color or by what these plots represent. If you click each individual plot, it shows the information that the plot represents in the data. The <strong>Jitter</strong> function allows you to disperse the plots in order to see other plots that are close to each other/ overlap one another. 
    </p>
